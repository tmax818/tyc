# [lesson 5: packaging code in functions](./lesson05/README.md)

# understanding functions

## a function defined

function  
: a named independent section of C code that performs a specific task and optionally returns a value to the calling program.

[cube.c](./cube.c)

# how a function works

argument  
: program data sent to the function

# syntax

## functions

## function prototype

: provides the compiler with a description of a function that will be defined at a later point in the program

*return-type function_name(type param)*

## function definition

: the actual function

# functions and structured programming

structured programming  
: individual program tasks are performed by independent sections of program code.

## the advantages of structured programming

- easier to write
- easier to debug

## planning a structured program

>Your plan should be a list of the specific tasks your program performs

## the top-down approach

- program structure resembles an inverted tree


# writing a function

> The first step in writing a function is to know what you want the function to do.

## the function header

- consists of three parts
  - return type
  - name
  - parameter list *if applicable*
